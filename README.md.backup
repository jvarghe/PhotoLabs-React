# PhotoLabs-React

PhotoLabs is a React-based SPA photo gallery website. It serves gorgeous images from a number of categories. You can see photos by topic by clicking on the topics in the navigation bar. You can favourite images by clicking on their heart icon. If you want a closer look, you can click on an image, which will open a modal view with a larger version of the picture. You will also be presented with other similar photos.
